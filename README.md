##Task
Given a description of cache servers, network endpoints and videos, along with predicted requests for
individual videos, â€‹decide which videos to put in which cache server in order to minimize the average
waiting time for all requests.

### Example Input
5 2 4 3 100

50 50 80 30 110

1000 3

0 100

2 200

1 300

500 0

3 0 1500

0 1 1000

4 0 500

1 0 1000

5 videos, 2 endpoints, 4 request descriptions, 3 caches 100MB each.

Videos 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 have sizes 50MB, 50MB, 80MB, 30MB, 110MB.

Endpoint 0 has 1000ms datacenter latency and is connected to 3 caches:

The latency (of endpoint 0) to cache 0 is 100ms.

The latency (of endpoint 0) to cache 2 is 200ms.

The latency (of endpoint 0) to cache 1 is 200ms.

Endpoint 1 has 500ms datacenter latency and is not connected to a cache.

1500 requests for video 3 coming from endpoint 0.

1000 requests for video 0 coming from endpoint 1.

500 requests for video 4 coming from endpoint 0.

1000 requests for video 1 coming from endpoint 0.
